# Features & Structure
## Existing Features
### Site-Level Elements
##### <u>Navbar</u>
This is a [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) navbar that is fixed to the top of the page. It contains links to the Home, About, Projects and Contact sections of the site. The navbar is responsive and collapses to a hamburger menu on smaller screens.
##### <u>Social Media Links</u>
These are located in the footer of the site and are represented by the social media icons for LinkedIn, GitHub, Instagram and Twitter. They are links to Bill's profiles on these platforms.
##### <u>Footer</u>
The footer uses bootstrap classes and the code was sourced from [mdbootstrap](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/navigation/footer/)
### Page-Level Elements
#### Home
The home page is all about getting a sense of who Bill is. The feel of the site is clean and slick, with a modern, techy feel. The colour scheme is grey with a the odd pop of lime green and hot pink.
##### <u>Hero Image</u>
This is a full-width image of Bill Saunders, the site owner, and is the first thing the user sees when they visit the site. It is designed to be eye-catching and to give the user a sense of who Bill is and what he does.
##### <u>Buzz Words</u>
Catchy phrases that describe Bill's skills and interests. These are designed to be impactful and to reinforce the user's sense of what Bill is about. A pop of lime green is used to make one of the buzz words stand out.
##### <u>All about Bill</u>
This is essentially a personal statement written in a distinctive and personal style, rather than a dry, corporate bio. It is designed to be engaging and to give the user a sense of Bill's personality and ethos.

#### About
The branding on the About page is consistent with the homepage. The page is designed to give the user more detail Bill's background and career journey. There is no hero image on this page - the visuals do the work instead.
##### <u>Timeline</u>
This is a timeline of Bill's career, with key events and achievements. It is designed to be easy to read and to give the user a sense of Bill's career journey. The template code was sourced from a [Code Institute lesson](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/resume-miniproject-bootstrap4/) and 'translated' to Bootstrap 5 and customised to suit the site's design.
##### <u>Skills & Competencies</u>
This provides some more detail on the programming languages, technologies and tools that Bill is skilled in. The progress bars were inspired by [Matt Rudge](https://github.com/lechien73)'s lesson on building a [resume page](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/resume-miniproject-bootstrap4/) in the Code Institute course. However, the code was taken from [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/progress/) and customised with custom css.
#### Projects
This is a list of Bill's favourite project on GitHub. The look and feel of the site is on-brand, consisting on mainly grey with pops of lime green and hot pink. The hero image on this page was generated by AI ([DALL-E](https://openai.com/dall-e-3)) and is designed to be eye-catching and to give the user a sense of what the page is about.

#### Contact
This is a simple contact form that allows the user to get in touch with Bill. The branding is consistent with the rest of the site. The form is designed to be simple and easy to use, with a clean, modern feel. The form is very basic HTML but uses [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com) classes for style and format.

## Future Features
<ul>
    <li>I will leverage JavaScript to programmatically interact with  <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28">GitHub's API</a>, enabling the automatic population and updating of the list showcasing my most recently starred repositories.</li>
    <li>I will use JavaScript to randomly highlight individual 'Buzz Words' in lime green for a few seconds.</li>
    <li>I will use JavaScript to recreate the parallax effect, as this is not supported in css in mobile browsers I tested.</li>
