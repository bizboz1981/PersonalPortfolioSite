# Features & Structure
## Existing Features
### Site-Level Elements
##### Navbar
This is a [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) navbar that is fixed to the top of the page. It contains links to the Home, About, Projects and Contact sections of the site. The navbar is responsive and collapses to a hamburger menu on smaller screens.
##### Social Media Links
These are located in the footer of the site and are represented by the social media icons for LinkedIn, GitHub, Instagram and Twitter. They are links to Bill's profiles on these platforms.
##### Footer
The footer uses bootstrap classes and the code was sourced from [mdbootstrap](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/navigation/footer/)
### Page-Level Elements
#### Home
The home page is all about getting a sense of who Bill is. The feel of the site is clean and slick, with a modern, techy feel. The colour scheme is grey with a the odd pop of lime green and hot pink.
##### Hero Image
This is a full-width image of Bill Saunders, the site owner, and is the first thing the user sees when they visit the site. It is designed to be eye-catching and to give the user a sense of who Bill is and what he does.
##### Buzz Words
Catchy phrases that describe Bill's skills and interests. These are designed to be impactful and to reinforce the user's sense of what Bill is about. A pop of lime green is used to make one of the buzz words stand out.
##### All about Bill
This is essentially a personal statement written in a distinctive and personal style, rather than a dry, corporate bio. It is designed to be engaging and to give the user a sense of Bill's personality and ethos.

#### About
The branding on the About page is consistent with the homepage. The page is designed to give the user more detail Bill's background and career journey. There is no hero image on this page - the visuals do the work instead.
##### Timeline
This is a timeline of Bill's career, with key events and achievements. It is designed to be easy to read and to give the user a sense of Bill's career journey. The template code was sourced from a [Code Institute lesson](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/resume-miniproject-bootstrap4/) and 'translated' to Bootstrap 5 and customised to suit the site's design.
##### Skills & Competencies
This provides some more detail on the programming languages, technologies and tools that Bill is skilled in. The progress bars were inspired by [Matt Rudge](https://github.com/lechien73)'s lesson on building a [resume page](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/resume-miniproject-bootstrap4/) in the Code Institute course. However, the code was taken from [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/progress/) and customised with custom css.
#### Projects
This is a list of Bill's favourite project on GitHub. The look and feel of the site is on-brand, consisting on mainly grey with pops of lime green and hot pink. The hero image on this page was generated by AI ([DALL-E](https://openai.com/dall-e-3)) and is designed to be eye-catching and to give the user a sense of what the page is about.

#### Contact
This is a simple contact form that allows the user to get in touch with Bill. The branding is consistent with the rest of the site. The form is designed to be simple and easy to use, with a clean, modern feel. The form is very basic HTML but uses [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com) classes for style and format.

## Future Features
* I will leverage JavaScript to programmatically interact with [GitHub's API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28), enabling the automatic population and updating of the list showcasing my most recently starred repositories.
* I will use JavaScript to randomly highlight individual 'Buzz Words' in lime green for a few seconds.
* I will use JavaScript to recreate the parallax effect, as this is not supported in CSS in mobile browsers I tested (apparently due to the [high repaint cost](https://forums.developer.apple.com/forums/thread/99883)).
* I will, in due course, deploy to a custom URL.

# Design
## Colour Scheme
The colour scheme uses a lot of grey. The main colour "brand-dark-gray" (#2f2f2f) was sampled from the hero image on the home page. The inspiration of pairing this with the secondary brand colour green ("brand-lime": #00ff00) and the tertiary pink ("brand-pink": #ff00ff) was taken from [here](https://www.schemecolor.com/pink-grey-green.php). Contrast was checked for accessibility using[WebAIM's contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/). The green and pink are used sparingly to add a pop of colour and to make the site feel modern and fresh. The green is used for the navbar, the hero image on the home page, the 'Buzz Words' on the home page, the progress bars on the About page and the 'Send' button on the Contact page. The pink is used for the 'Buzz Word' on the home page and the 'Send' button on the Contact page. The grey is used for the background of the site and the text. The white is used for the text and the progress bars on the About page.

* [Chat GPT](http://chat.openai.com) - I have used Chat GPT to explain concepts to me, and to help me use VS Code and the terminal more efficiently. I have also used it to explain code snippets from other sources in greater detail. I have specifically not used Chat GPT to write code for me. All source code in the project is credited where approrpriate.
* [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - used extensively for inspiration, problem solving and occasionally for template code.
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) - primarily for troubleshooting issues.
* [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com) - as a user of Codecademy for a number of years, I must credit this site for any background knowledge I may have had.

In addition to the above, I have tested extensively in the Chrome DevTools device emulator and have tested the site on a number of other devices and browsers. The site is fully responsive and works well on all devices and browsers I have tested. The only issues I encountered were with the parallax effect, which is not supported on my iPhone 14 Pro, and I will need to address this in future updates with JavaScript. To solve the issue for now, I have set `background-attachment: scroll` in the media query for mobile devices.

I used the following media queries to ensure the site was responsive on all devices. The code was taken from [Coding with Jaybird](https://github.com/codingwithjaybird)'s GitHub. You can see this is in action on this [video here](https://youtu.be/BGIj3womITo?si=58FcgvDYxeEX7lY5):



```
/* Small devices (landscape phones, 576px and up) */
@media (min-width: 576px) {
  #breakpoints::before {
    content: "Small screens and up (>576px Landscape phones) - 'sm'";
    background-color: aquamarine;
  }
}

/* Medium devices (tablets, 768px and up) */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  #breakpoints::before {
    content: "Medium screens and up (>768px Tablets) - 'md'";
    background-color: aquamarine;
  }
}

/* Large devices (desktops, 992px and up) */
@media (min-width: 992px) {
  #breakpoints::before {
    content: "Large screens and up (>992px Desktops) - 'lg'";
    background-color: aquamarine;
  }
}

/* X-Large devices (large desktops, 1200px and up) */
@media (min-width: 1200px) {
  #breakpoints::before {
    content: "Extra Large screens and up (>1200px Large Desktops) - 'xl'";
    background-color: aquamarine;
  }
}

/* XX-Large devices (larger desktops, 1400px and up) */

@media (min-width: 1400px) {
  #breakpoints::before {
    content: "Extra Extra Large screens and up (>1400px Larger Desktops) - 'xxl'";
    background-color: aquamarine;
  }
}
```


### Online Validation Services
* [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) - all colours used passed the contrast checker. Apart from white on brand dark grey (which has a contrast ration of 13.38:1) the main contrast is brand lime green on brand grey which has a score of almost 10:1.
* [HTML Validator]([https://validator.w3.org) - all pages received a clean bill of health, with no errors or warnings to show.
* [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - when scanning the URL of the site, the validator finds a surprising number of errors and warnings. However, all of these are associated with Bootstrap and nothing to do with the custom css (in fact, the [Code Institute site](https://codeinstitute.net)) generates a similar number of Bootstrap errors. The custom css (on direct input) has no errors.
* [accessiBe](https://accessibe.com/accessscan) - accessibility scan informs me that the website is mostly compliant, but did suggest some areas for improvement, which I will address in future updates., Interestingly, the [Code Institute site](https://codeinstitute.net) fails on many of the same elements, suggesting that 'accessibility' is more of an ongoing commitment rather than a realistic, perfect end-state.


### Lighthouse
I used the Lighthouse tool in Chrome DevTools to test the site's performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO. The results were as follows: 98% | 100% |100% |100% | NA. The only area for improvement was the 'Performance' score, which was 98%. This was partly due to the size and performance of the hero image. I plan to change this to webp format.
